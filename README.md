# CodeAlpha_Iris-Flower-Classification
The Iris Flower Classification project predicts the species of an Iris flower (Setosa, Versicolor, or Virginica) using four key features â€” sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. It covers the complete machine learning workflow, including data exploration, visualization, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
